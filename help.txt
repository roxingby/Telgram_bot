Roberto's bot answers to the following commands:

/balance - write here the equation you want to balance
/checkbalance - write here the equation you want to check whether it's balanced or not
/getElements - write here an equation(or just a reaction) to see its elements

Always write the equation in the form of: 'H2 + O2 == H2O'
If you want to check a reaction with /getElements you can write it in the form of: '2H2 + O2'

You can write /help to let this message appear again.
